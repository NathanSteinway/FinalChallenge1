# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this assignment, I was asked to refactor code for a website.

    My primary mission in doing so was to make the code more readable and gear the website more toward accessiblity for disabled persons.

I did so by:

     adding descriptive comments in both the HTML and CSS files

     Spacing and indenting lines of code where appropriate to promote readability

     Categorizing each section using Semantic HTML elements

     Reorganizing elements in the CSS file

     Repairing image links

     Repairing the "search engine optimization" link at the top right of the page

     Applying CSS formatting elements (like .content) to its respective elements in the HTML document

     Ensuring sequential use of headers

     Providing a concise title in the <head></head> area of the document
